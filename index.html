        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Jerusalyn Bahandi but you can call me Jay. I am a passionate <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Game Developer</strong> with a strong foundation in programming and digital design. I have gained practical experience as a <strong>Web Developer</strong> over the past year, where I contributed to the development of responsive and user-friendly websites. My background in <strong>Game Development</strong> comes from hands-on projects during my college years, where I honed my skills in game mechanics, design, and coding.
            With a combination of web and game development experience, I am eager to leverage my creativity, problem-solving abilities, and technical skills to contribute to innovative projects. I am highly motivated to continue learning and growing in both fields, bringing fresh ideas and a keen attention to detail to every project. 
        </p>
        <br>
        Below are all the projects I've made.

            <p>This was a prototype project that a friend of mine and I made. She did the art while I did the programming. This was also made using Unity Game Engine and we used Plastic SCM to be able to collaborate.

            <img src="images/mainmenu4.png" alt="Screenshot of Project 4">
            <p>This was one of the biggest projects I had to work on as a lead developer. I worked alone in the programming department. HORUS is a 2D fantasy RPG with branching dialogue and a storyline that puts you in ethical situations to test your principles. Making this game was a challenge because I had to implement a cause and effect system which was something I've never worked with. This was also made using Unity Game Engine with the addition of Ink Integration for Unity which was used to make dialogues and choices.</p>
